# Northwind-Challenge-Power-BI

Welcome to 25 days of DAX Fridays! Challenge, where one DAX puzzle will be available every day for you to solve from the first of December to the 25th of December.



More info on how to participate in the challenges here:

IMPORTANT!



1. Make sure you use this file and not the original Northwind.

2. Make sure you refresh the dataset daily and compare the results with mine the same day.

3. The level of difficulty will vary, although I have tried to make the questions in such way that you will be able to solve them with easy or elegant DAX.

4. Once you have the answer you can let me know in the comments or tweet it with the hashtag #25DaysOfDAXFridays #curbal.

5. IMPORTANT! When you share the answer on Linkedin or Twitter, please do not share the DAX code, so others can have a chance to participate too. You will be able to share the code on the solution video and I truly encourage you to do so, so we can learn from each other. Good luck!

6. It is never too late to start the challenge ;)

7. Have fun.
